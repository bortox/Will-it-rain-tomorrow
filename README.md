# Will-it-rain-tomorrow

This is my first pyqt5 project, so there could be lots of improvements in the code, I think. Feel free to open an issue or a pull request. 


A PyQt5 gui answering one simple question: will it rain tomorrow?
The answer is extracted using Open Wheater Map 's api to get forecast data for all the world.
It's cross platform, the only deps are PyQt5 and PyOWM.
